== Ruby invoicing framework

* Homepage: http://invoicing.rubyforge.org/

== DESCRIPTION

The Ruby invoicing framework provides tools, helpers and a structure for
applications (particularly web apps) which need to generate invoices for
customers. It builds on ActiveRecord and is particularly suited for Rails
applications, but could be used with other frameworks too.

== FEATURES

* Dealing with tax rates changing over time
* Calculating commissions (e.g. in a reseller setting)

== SYNOPSIS

== CREDITS

The Ruby invoicing framework originated as part of the website Bid for Wine
(http://www.bidforwine.co.uk), developed by Patrick Dietrich, Conrad Irwin
and Michael Arnold for Ept Computing Ltd. It was extracted from the Bid for
Wine codebase and substantially extended by Martin Kleppmann.
