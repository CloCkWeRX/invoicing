Ruby Invoicing Framework

The Ruby invoicing framework provides tools, helpers and a structure for
applications (particularly web apps) which need to generate invoices for
customers. It builds on ActiveRecord and is particularly suited for Rails
applications, but could be used with other frameworks too.
